\arguments{
\item{data}{the data to be used (representing a series of observations).}

\item{width}{numeric vector or list. In the simplest case this is an integer
    specifying the window width (in numbers of observations) which is aligned

    \code{width} can be a list regarded as offsets compared to the current
